# Regression-Analysis-on-Return-to-Education

This study investigates the return to educational attainment in the labor market in terms of income and employment rate among college graduates. 

## Abstract
I retrieved 108k+ panel data from a longitudinal survey, built ***Instrumental Variable (IV)*** regression model by using Higher Education Expansion policy as an external variable, identified the casual effect of educational attainment on income. I also studied the heterogeneous treatment effects on subgroups, conducted robustness check on IV, and tested the feasibility of alternative ***Regression Discontinuity design (RDD)***



## Background
In 1999, the Chinese government launched a higher education expansion policy, as a result, the number of new students enrolled in colleges increased by 40% in that year. The expansion induced by the policy continued for the following years. In this paper, the exogenous and unexpected policy is introduced as an **instrumental variable** for education attainment among students. 

## Model

This study uses Instrumental Variable (IV) approach and Two-Stage Least Squares(2SLS). 

## Result

Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey from 1989 to 2011, the results suggest that each additional year of college education induced by the 1999 higher education expansion increases monthly income by 23.5% and reduce unemployment rate by 0.25%. Our findings are robust to inclusion of control variables including social-economic factors of individualsâ€™ living community. The paper also finds the gender difference and urban-rural difference in the returns of education, and then further compares the college graduates and graduates from technical or vocational schools.
